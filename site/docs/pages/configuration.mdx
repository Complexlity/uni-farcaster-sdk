# Configuration Options

```ts
type configurationOptions =
  | {
      neynarApiKey?: string;
      airstackApiKey?: string;
      activeService?: "airstack" | "neynar";
      debug?: boolean;
      logLevel?: "info" | "warning" | "error" | "success";
      cacheTtl?: number;
      retries?: number;
      retryStrategy?: "normal" | "switch" | "switchTemp";
    }
  | undefined;

const sdkInstanceInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk(configurationOptions);
```

`configurationOptions` is an object that takes the properties below

## Neynar Api Key

```ts
const sdkInstanceInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  neynarApiKey: "NEYNAR_API_DOCS",
});
```

You'd need to get your api key from [neynar](https://neynar.com/)

:::info
`NEYNAR_API_DOCS` is a valid api key which is provided by neynar for testing purposes.
You can use it to test the sdk but you should not use it in production
:::

## Airstack Api Key

```ts
const sdkInstanceInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  airstackApiKey: "your-airstack-api-key",
});
```

You'd need to get your api key from [airstack](https://airstack.xyz/)

:::danger
`your-airstack-api-key` is NOT a valid airstack api key. You'd need to sign up on airstack to get one
:::

## Active Service

```ts
const sdkInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  activeService: "airstack",
});
```

You can specify which of the services you want to use.<br></br> By default, it will set the active service depending on which of the api keys you provide.<br></br>This option is especially useful when you have both api keys
provided.

:::info
Without the active service (when both api keys are provided), it randomly chooses one of them.
:::

## Cache Time To Live

```ts
const sdkInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  cacheTtl: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
});
```

By default, all queries are cached for 1 hour before they expire and would hit the external services again.
You can configure how long you want them to be cached for in milliseconds.

## Retries

```ts
const sdkInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  retries: 0,
});
```

By default on error, it returns the error and does not retry the query.
You can configure how many times you want to retry the query before returning the error.

## Retry Strategy

```ts
const sdkInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  retryStrategy: "switch",
});
```

Retry Strategy determines how you want to retry the query. There's 3 modes:

### normal

This is the default and it simply retries the query for the number of `retries` you have in your config using the same service as the initial request.

### switch

In this strategy, it changes the active service each time it retries.
This only works when you have both airstack and neynar api keys configured.

### switchTemp

This strategy works the same as `switch` but the difference is after all retries are completed (or successful), it switches back to the original service.

## Debug

When set to true, it would log all queries on the console. One way to use this is using the environment variable `NODE_ENV=development`

```ts
const debugMode = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";
const sdkInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  debug: debugMode,
});
```

## Log Level

In debug mode, this restricts what type of queries are logged to the console.
By default, it logs all queries.
This configuration only has an effect when `debug` is set to true

```ts
const sdkInstance = new uniFarcasterSdk({
  logLevel: "info",
  //Only logs of level "info" would show up on the console
});
```

You can choose from `info`, `warning`, `error` and `success`

## Example Instance

```ts
const sdkInstance = uniFarcasterSdk({
  neynarApiKey: "NEYNAR_API_DOCS",
  airstackApiKey: "your-airstack-api-key",
  activeService: "neynar",
  cacheTtl: 60 * 1 * 1000, // 1 Minute
  retries: 3,
  retryStrategy: "switchTemp",
  debug: true,
  logLevel: "success",
});
```
