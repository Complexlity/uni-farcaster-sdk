# Results and Error Handling

Every query returns an object of the format

```ts
//Successfull Query
type Result<ReturnedType> = {
  data: ReturnedType;
  error: null;
};

//Failed Query
type Result = {
  data: null;
  error: {
    message: string;
  };
};
```

## USER

```ts
type User = {
  fid: number;
  ethAddresses: string[];
  solAddresses: string[];
  username: string;
  displayName: string;
  bio: string;
  pfpUrl: string;
  followerCount: number;
  followingCount: number;
  powerBadge?: boolean;
  viewerContext: {
    following: boolean;
    followedBy: boolean;
  };
};
```

:::info
`ethAddresses` returns an array containing all the user's connected addresses and their custody address. The custody address is always the last on the list. <br></br>

e.g

```
const userCustodyAddress = user.ethAddresses.at(-1) //last item
```

You often want to get the user's connected address and fallback to their custody address if non is found, now you can just pick the first one from the array
:::

Queries: `getUserByFid` and `getUserByUsername`
returns `Result<User>`.

:::danger
When using airstack service, `getUserByUsername` does not return viewerContext so use `getUserByFid` whenever you can
:::

## CAST

```ts
type Cast = {
  //Author's viewer context does not always exist in this case
  author: UserWithOptionalViewerContext;
  hash: string;
  url: string;
  userReactions: {
    likes: number;
    recasts: number;
  };
  viewerContext: {
    liked: boolean;
    recasted: boolean;
  };
  text: string;
  embeds: unknown[];
  channel: string | null;
};
```

Queries `getCastByHash` and `getCastByUrl` returns `Result<Cast>`

## Custom Queries

`sdk.neynar` and `sdk.airstack` return `Result<unknown>` since the returned value is not predicatable.

However, you can type the returned value yourself

```ts
type MyCustomReturnType = {
  name: string;
  id: string;
  value: number;
};
const { data, error } = await sdkInstance.neynar<MyCustomReturnType>(
  endpoint,
  queryParams
);
const { data, error } = await sdkInstance.airstack<MyCustomReturnType>(
  endpoint,
  queryParams
);

// Now, you get type completion as though typescript knows what the returned value is
```

:::danger
Be careful when typing yourself as you could 'lie' to the compiler in this way
